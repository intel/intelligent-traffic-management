# Intelligent Traffic Management Reference Implementation
## Overview


Intelligent Traffic Management is designed to detect and track vehicles as well
as pedestrians and to estimate a safety metric for an intersection. Object
tracking recognizes the same object across successive frames, giving the ability
to estimate trajectories and speeds of the objects. The reference implementation
also detects collisions and near misses. A real-time dashboard visualizes the
intelligence extracted from the traffic intersection along with annotated video
stream(s).

This collected intelligence can be used to adjust traffic lights to optimize the
traffic flow of the intersection, or to evaluate and enhance the safety of the
intersection by allowing Emergency services notifications i.e. 911 calls, to be
triggered by collision detection, reducing emergency response times.

To run the reference implementation, you will need to first configure the
control plane host and the worker node host as presented on
[Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

-   **Time to Complete:** 30- 45 minutes
-   **Programming Language:** Python\*
-   **Software:**
	-   Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2021 Release
	-   Kubernetes*


## Target System Requirements

### Control Plane

-   One of the following processors:

    - 6th to 12th Generation Intel® Core™ processors with Iris® Pro graphics or Intel® HD Graphics

-   At least 32 GB RAM.

-   At least 256 GB hard drive.

-   An Internet connection.

-   One of the following operating systems:
    - Ubuntu\* 20.04 LTS Server.
    - Lubuntu\* 20.04 LTS.

### Worker Nodes

-   One of the following processors:

    - 6th to 12th Generation Intel® Core™ processors with Iris® Pro graphics or Intel® HD Graphics

-   At least 32 GB RAM.

-   At least 256 GB hard drive.

-   An Internet connection.

-   One of the following operating systems:
    - Ubuntu\* 20.04 LTS Server.
    - Lubuntu\* 20.04 LTS.

-   IP camera or pre-recorded video(s).

## How It Works

The application uses the inference engine and the Intel® Deep Learning Streamer (Intel® DL Streamer)
included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. The solution is
designed to detect and track vehicles and pedestrians and upload cloud data to an AWS S3 storage.

<img src="docs/itm_1_how_it_works.png" />

Figure 1: How It Works

The Intelligent Traffic Management application requires the services pods,
database and a visualizer. Once the installation is successful, the
application is ready to be deployed using Helm. After the deployment,
the application pod takes in the virtual/real RTSP stream addresses and
performs inference and sends metadata for each stream to the InfluxDB*
database. The visualizer in parallel shows the analysis over the
metadata like pedestrians detected, observed collisions and processed
video feed.

The application has capability to perform inferences over as much as 20
channels. In addition, the visualizer is capable of showing each feed
separately as well as all the feeds at the same time using Grafana\*. The
user can visualize the output remotely over a browser, provided that
they are in the same network.

New in this release are Rule Engine and Cloud Connector pods.

*   Rule engine analyzes each video frame and its inference results. If it matches
    the configured rules (collision, near miss, overcrowd), it sends the
    video frame to Cloud Connector to be uploaded to the cloud storage.

*   Cloud Connector uses [Amazon Web Services* Cloud Storage](#set-up-amazon-web-services-cloud-storage) to save the
    video captures.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

In order to run the latest version of Intelligent Traffic Management, you will need 2 Linux hosts: one for Kubernetes control plane and one for Kubernetes worker. The following steps describe how to prepare both targets before installing the reference implementation.

1. Install docker-ce and docker-compose. Run the following commands on both targets:

   - Install the latest Docker CLI and Docker daemon by following the Docker
   instructions to [Install using the
   repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
   and [Install Docker
   Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-docker-engine).

   - Run Docker without sudo following the [Manage Docker as a non-root
   user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
   instructions.

   - If your hosts are running behind a HTTP/S proxy server, perform these
   steps. If not, you can skip this step.

       - Configure proxy settings for the Docker\* client to connect to
          internet and for containers to access the internet by following
          [Configure Docker to use a proxy server](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/).
    
       - Configure proxy settings for the Docker\* daemon by following
          [HTTP/HTTPS proxy](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy).
 
   - Install the docker-compose tool by following [Install Compose](
   https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).
 
   - Configure the Docker service by adding the following to the
	``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` file:

      ```
         {
             "exec-opts": [
                 "native.cgroupdriver=systemd"
             ]
         }
      ```


2. Install Helm. Run the following commands on both targets:
    ```
    curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
    echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install helm
    ```

3. Install and configure the Kubernetes cluster. Run the following commands on both targets:

	- Get Google key:
      ```
      curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add
      ```

	- Add kube apt repo:
      ```
      echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" >> ~/kubernetes.list
      sudo mv ~/kubernetes.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d
      ```

	- Disable swap on your machine. (Kubernetes cluster doesn't work while using swap memory.)
      ```
      sudo swapoff -a
      ```


	- Install Kubernetes binaries
      ```
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yq kubelet=1.23.4-00 kubeadm=1.23.4-00 kubectl=1.23.4-00 kubernetes-cni
      ```


4. Initialize the Kubernetes cluster on the Control Plane machine:
    ```
	sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
    ```

    >**NOTE:** Save the kube join command prompted at the end of the cluster creation.


5. Configure access to Kubernetes cluster:
	- Current user configuration:
      ```
      sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
      sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
      ```
	- Root user configuration:
      ```
      sudo su -
      mkdir .kube
      cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
      exit
      ```

	- Enable kubelet service:
      ```
      sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/cni/
      sudo systemctl restart kubelet.service
      ```

	- Check kubelet service status using ``sudo systemctl status kubelet.service`` (status should be active).

6. Add network plugin to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/k8s-manifests/kube-flannel-rbac.yml
   ```

7. Check that the current node is ready by using the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get nodes -A
    ```

	Output should look like:
    ```
    NAME                STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
    Machine1          Ready    control-plane,master   1m     v1.23.4
    ```

8. Join Kubernetes worker node:
	- If you didn't save the join command in step 4, run the following command on the control plane to generate another token. (If you have the join command, skip this step.)

       ```
      kubeadm token create --print-join-command
      ```
	- Run the kubeadm join command on the worker node, for example:

      ```
      kubeadm join <Controller_IP>:6443 --token token12456.token12456 \
         --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<sha_of_the_kubernetes_certificate>
      ```
	- If join failed, proceed with the following step and give kubelet access to network policy:

      ```
      sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/cni/
      ```

9. Configure Kubernetes on worker side:
	- Create .kube config folder on worker side:
      ```
      mkdir $HOME/.kube
      ```
   - Copy the configuration file from controller to worker node:

      ```
      scp /home/controller_user/.kube/config worker_user@worker_ip:/home/worker_user/.kube/
      ```

	- Restart kubelet service:
      ```
      sudo systemctl restart kubelet.service
      ```

10. Check Kubernetes nodes from both machines to be ready with the command:
    ```
	 kubectl get nodes -A
    ```

	Output should look similar to:
    ```
    NAME                                    STATUS   ROLES                              AGE     VERSION
    Control-plane-host-name                 Ready    control-plane,master               5m      v1.23.4
    Worker-host-name                        Ready    <unassigned>                       1m      v1.23.4
	```

11. Assign role to the worker node from control-plane host:

    ```
    kubectl label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
    ```
	Check again to see that the label was placed using the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get nodes -A
    ```

    Output should look similar to:
    ```
    NAME                                    STATUS   ROLES                              AGE     VERSION
    Control-plane-host-name                 Ready    control-plane,master               5m      v1.23.4
    Worker-host-name                        Ready    worker                             1m      v1.23.4
    ```

>**NOTE:** For local build using harbor local registry, add the following line in the ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` configuration file: 
``"insecure-registries": ["https://WORKER_IP:30003"]``



### Step 1: Install the Reference Implementation

>**NOTE:** The following sections may use ``<Controller_IP>`` in a URL
or command. Make note of your Edge Controller’s IP address and
substitute it in these instructions.

Select **Configure &
Download** to download
the reference implementation and then follow the steps below to install
it.

[Configure &
Download](https://software.intel.com/iot/edgesoftwarehub/download/home/ri/intelligent_traffic_management)

1.  Make sure that the [Target System Requirements](#target-system-requirements)
    are met properly before proceeding further.


2.  If you are behind a proxy network, please ensure that proxy addresses are configured in the system:

    ```
    export http_proxy=proxy-address:proxy-port
    export https_proxy=proxy-address:proxy-port
    ```

3.  Open a new terminal, go to the downloaded folder and unzip the downloaded package:
    ```
    unzip intelligent_traffic_management.zip
    ```

4.  Go to the intelligent_traffic_management/
    directory.

    ```
    cd intelligent_traffic_management
    ```

5.  Change permissions of the executable edgesoftware file to enable
    execution.

    ```
    chmod 755 edgesoftware
    ```

6.  Run the command below to install the Reference Implementation:

    ```
    ./edgesoftware install
    ```

7.  During the installation, you will be prompted for the AWS Key ID, AWS Secret, AWS Bucket and Product Key.
    The Product Key is contained in the email you received from Intel
    confirming your download.
    AWS credentials are optional. AWS Key ID, AWS Secret and AWS Bucket are obtained after following
    [Amazon Web Services* Cloud Storage Setup](#set-up-amazon-web-services-cloud-storage).
    If you do not need the cloud upload feature, simply provide empty values by pressing **Enter** when prompted for the AWS
    credentials.

### Step 2: Check the Application

Check the Intelligent_Traffic_Management pods with the command:

```
kubectl get pod -A
```

You will see output similar to:

<img src="docs/itm_6_status_of_itm_pods.png" />

Figure 6: Status of Intelligent Traffic Management pods

>**NOTE:** If the pods have a status of “ContainerCreating”, please wait
for some time, since Kubernetes will pull the images from the registry
and then deploy them. This happens only the first time the containers
are deployed, and the wait time will depend upon the network bandwidth
available.

### Step 3: Data Visualization on Grafana

1.  Navigate to https://Controller_IP:30300/dashboard on your browser
    to check Intelligent Traffic Management dashboard.

    `./edgesoftware uninstall –a`

3.  Run the command below to uninstall the Intelligent Traffic Management reference implementation:

    `./edgesoftware uninstall <itm-id get from step 1>`

    <img src="docs/itm_16_uninstall_modules.png" />

    Figure 17: Uninstalled Modules


### Public Helm Registry for Helm Charts

Installation of Intelligent Traffic Management Reference Implementation on local Kubernetes Cluster is accomplished using Helm charts. In earlier releases, Helm charts used to be a part of Reference Implementation installation package. Now a global Helm repo is issued
so that Reference Implementation Helm charts can be accessible from private and public networks. This will speed up and
ease the process of introducing updates and their integration with Reference Implementation.

## Local Build Instructions

After you have installed Kubernetes Cluster from Prerequisites, you can build your own Intelligent Traffic Management Docker image using the following instructions.

You can proceed with the steps presented using either edgesoftware sources or GitHub sources: [Intelligent Traffic Management](http://www.github.com/intel/intelligent-traffic-management)

### Setup
Change the directory to repository path with one of the following options.

For GitHub:

```
git clone
cd intelligent_traffic_management/
```

Use your preferred text editor to make the following file updates.

In the next steps, the tag `<REPOSITORY_PATH>` indicates the path to the repository.

In the Change examples, replace the line indicated by **-** with the line indicated by **+**

1. `<REPOSITORY_PATH>/src/build_images.sh` - update the tag and version for the image.
   ```
   Change example:
   -    TAG="5.0"
   +    TAG="5.1"
   ```
2. `<REPOSITORY_PATH>/deploy/services/values.yaml` - update image deployment harbor.
   ```
   Change example:
   - images:
   -   registry: ""
   + images:
   +   registry: <local harbor host>:<local_harbor_port>/library/
   ```
3. `<REPOSITORY_PATH>/deploy/services/values.yaml` - update version.
   ```
   Change example:
   - images:
   -   tag: "5.0"
   + images:
   +   tag: "5.1"
   ```
### Build and Install

Build the Docker image with the following commands:

```
# Login on your Harbor Docker registry
docker login WORKER_IP:30003
user: admin
password: Harbor12345
cd <REPOSITORY_PATH>/src/
./build_images.sh -c worker_ip   # The local Docker image will be built on the Ubuntu machine.
```

Install Helm with the following commands:

1. Get Grafana password:

    ```
    kubectl get secrets/grafana -n default -o json | jq -r '.data."admin-password"' | base64 -d
    ```

2. Get Grafana service IP using the following command:

    ```
    kubectl describe service -n default grafana |grep -i Endpoint
    ```

3. Get the host IP using the following command:

    ```
    hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
    ```

4. Change directory to deployment directory from repository path:

    ```
    cd <REPOSITORY_PATH>/deploy/
    ```

5. Deploy the MQTT broker and wait for it to initialize:

    ```
    helm install broker broker/ --set namespace=default
    kubectl wait --namespace=default --for=condition=Ready pods --timeout=600s --selector=app=hivemq-cluster
    ```


6. Using the host IP, Grafana service IP and password from steps 1 and 2, run the following Helm installation command:

    ```
    helm install itm services/ --wait --timeout 10m \
          --set grafana.password=<Grafana_Password> \
          --set grafana.ip=<Grafana_PodIP> \
          --set host_ip=<Controller_IP> \
          --set namespace=default \
          --set proxy.http=<HTTP_PROXY> \
          --set proxy.https=<HTTPS_PROXY> \
          --set cloud_connector.aws_key=<AWS_KEY_ID> \
          --set cloud_connector.aws_secret=<AWS_SECRET> \
          --set cloud_connector.aws_bucket=<AWS_BUCKET>
    ```

>**NOTES:** 1: If your host is not behind a firewall, then skip setting the http and https proxy.
>
>2: Cloud connector requires your AWS credentials to connect to it to upload video captures in case of collision,
>near miss and overcrowd events. If you don't want this feature enabled, then skip setting these parameters.
>For instructions on how to configure AWS, refer to the [Set Up Amazon Web Services* CLoud Storage](#set-up-amazon-web-services-cloud-storage) section. 



After step 6 completes, use your preferred browser to access ITM at: https://Controller_IP:30300 and
Grafana https://Controller_IP:32000

### Optional Steps

#### Configure the Input

The Helm templates contain all the necessary configurations for the cameras.

If you wish to change the input, edit the ``./helm/services/values.yaml`` file and
add the video inputs to the ``test_videos`` array:
```
itm_video_inference:
  name: "itm-video-inference"
  topic:
    publisher: "camera"
  test_videos:
    - uri: "file:///app/test_videos/video_car_crash.avi"
    - uri: "file:///app/test_videos/video_pedestrians.avi"
```

To use camera stream instead of video, replace the video file
name with ``/dev/video0``

To use RTSP stream instead of video, replace the video file name
with the RTSP link.

Each ITM Video Inference service will pick a video input in the order above.

If you wish to change the coordinates, address and the analytics type of the cameras, edit
the ``./helm/services/templates/itm-analytics-configmap.yaml`` file:


-   **address:** Name of the camera’s geographic location. Must be a
    non-empty alphanumeric string.

-   **latitude:** Latitude of the camera’s geographic location.

-   **longitude:** Longitude of the camera’s geographic location.

-   **analytics:** Attribute to be detected by the model.

    >**NOTE:** The default model support pedestrian, vehicle and bike
    detection. User can select desired attributes from these, e.g.,
    "analytics": "pedestrian vehicle detection".


#### Stop the Application

To remove the deployment of this reference implementation, run the
following commands.

>**NOTE:** The following commands will remove all the running pods and
the data and configuration stored in the device, except the MQTT Broker.

```
helm delete itm
```

If you wish to remove the MQTT Broker also, enter the command:

```
helm delete broker
```

## Set Up Amazon Web Services Cloud* Storage

To enable Cloud Storage on the installed Reference Implementation, you
will need Amazon Web Services\* (AWS*) paid/free subscription to enable
your root user account that has to support the following services:


-  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
-  Amazon S3 Bucket


After finishing the setup for IAM and S3, you will have your
AWS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_KEY and AWS_BUCKET_NAME to be used
on your Intelligent Traffic Management
Cloud Connector - Configuration.

10. After you have saved the keys, close the tab. You are returned to the
   IAM Dashboard page.


11. Click on the user created and save the **User ARN** to be used on S3
   bucket setup.


>**NOTE:**
      In case you forgot to save the AWS Secret key from the User tab,
      you can select **Security Credentials**, delete the Access Key and
      create another one.

9. You must add a comma before adding the following information.
    ```
    {
      "Sid": "<Statement name>",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
          "AWS": "<User_ARN_Saved>"
      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>",
          "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    a. Update with the following statement with statement name, your user
      ARN saved at IAM setup - step 11 and your bucket name.

    b. Click on **Save changes**. If the change is successful, you will
     see a **success saved** message, otherwise you need to re-analyze
     the json file to fix the error.


## Summary and Next Steps

This application successfully implements Intel® Distribution of
OpenVINO™ toolkit plugins for detecting and tracking vehicles and
pedestrians and may be used for a basis in estimating a safety
metric for an intersection. It can be extended further to provide
support for a feed from a network stream (RTSP or camera device).

As a next step, you can experiment with accuracy/throughput trade-offs
by substituting object detector models and tracking and collision
detection algorithms with alternative ones.


## Create a Microsoft Azure* IoT Central Dashboard 

As a next step, you can create an Azure* IoT Central dashboard for this
reference implementation, run standalone Python code to fetch telemetry
data from InfluxDB, and send data to the Azure IoT Central dashboard
for visualizing telemetry data. See
[Connect Edge Devices to Azure IoT*](http://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/connect-devices-to-azure-iot.html#itm)
for instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Pods status check

Verify that the pods are “**Ready**” as well as in “**Running**” state
using below command:

```
kubectl get pods -A
```

If any pods are not in “Running” state, use the following command to get
more information about the pod state:

```
kubectl describe -n default pod <pod_name>
```

### ITM Dashboard Not Showing on Browser After Restart Server

Run the following commands:

```
# Get Grafana pod ip
kubectl get pod -n default -owide |grep grafana* 
grafana-8465558bc8-5p65x            3/3     Running   24 (5h23m ago)   12d   10.245.179.203

#update ITM yaml file
kubectl set env itm -n default GRAFANA_HOST=10.245.179.203

```

### Pod status shows “ContainerCreating” for long time

If Pod status shows “ContainerCreating” or “Error” or “CrashLoopBackOff” for a while (5 minutes or more), run the following commands:

```
reboot
su
swapoff -a
systemctl restart kubelet  # Wait till all pods are in “Running” state.
./edgesoftware install
```

### Subprocess:32 issue

If you see any error related to subprocess, run the command below:

`pip install --ignore-installed subprocess32==3.5.4`
